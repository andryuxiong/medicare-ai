A full-stack healthcare assistant that helps users identify possible conditions and over-the-counter medications based on symptoms. Built with modern technologies and a focus on user experience.

## ‚ú® Features

- ü§ñ AI-powered symptom analysis using OpenAI's GPT-3.5
- üé§ Voice input capability for easy symptom description
- üíä Smart medication suggestions
- üé® Modern, responsive UI with dark/light mode
- üîí Secure API key management
- üöÄ Fast and reliable performance

## What will I probably work on in the future for this project
> **Note:** Bilingual support (English/Spanish) is currently disabled as the translation service is turned off.
 - Will add support translation services in future
 - Still adding more health databases to help with context, a bigger database means the AI uses less tokens and instead uses pure data from backend
 - Add better UX ie. user history to keep track and add context to the assistant
 - Mobile App using react native 
 - Add better support for follow-up questions and conversational aspects of the assistant

 ## What was difficult for this project?
_ API integration - integrating multiple API's like openAI or web speech was pretty difficult while trying to maintain real-time performance and handling various edge cases. Took a lot of testing lol

- Managing state interactions between voice input, ai processing, and UI updates while also mainting the smooth UX causing a lot of errors and bug fixes.

- There were a lot of API handling failures, network failures, I did a lot of testing on local development for it to work and then after deploying it just to not work :/ 

- Had to fix invalid inputs and change prompts as the prompts wouldnt output correctly or wasnt to my liking.

- Also deploying both frontend and backend so they both can work together was pretty difficult as sometime the frontend wouldnt call the backend correctly
