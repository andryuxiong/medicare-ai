A full-stack healthcare assistant that helps users identify possible conditions and over-the-counter medications based on symptoms. Built with modern technologies and a focus on user experience.

## ‚ú® Features

- ü§ñ AI-powered symptom analysis using OpenAI's GPT-3.5
- üé§ Voice input capability for easy symptom description
- üíä Smart medication suggestions
- üé® Modern, responsive UI with dark/light mode
- üîí Secure API key management
- üöÄ Fast and reliable performance

## What will I probably work on in the future for this project
> **Note:** Bilingual support (English/Spanish) is currently disabled as the translation service is turned off.
 - Will add support translation services in future
 - Still adding more health databases to help with context, a bigger database means the AI uses less tokens and instead uses pure data from backend
 - Add better UX ie. user history to keep track and add context to the assistant
 - Mobile App using react native 
 - Add better support for follow-up questions and conversational aspects of the assistant

 ## What was difficult for this project?
- API integration - integrating multiple API's like openAI or web speech was pretty difficult while trying to maintain real-time performance and handling various edge cases. Took a lot of testing lol

- Managing state interactions between voice input, ai processing, and UI updates while also mainting the smooth UX causing a lot of errors and bug fixes.

- There were a lot of API handling failures, network failures, I did a lot of testing on local development for it to work and then after deploying it just to not work :/ 

- Had to fix invalid inputs and change prompts as the prompts wouldnt output correctly or wasnt to my liking.

- Also deploying both frontend and backend so they both can work together was pretty difficult as sometime the frontend wouldnt call the backend correctly


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - React.js
  - Material-UI
  - Speech Recognition API
  - Responsive Design

## How it works
  const [input, setInput] = useState (""); and const [chat, setChat] = useState([]);
  // Stores user and chat messages 

  async function send() {
   const userMsg = { from: "user", } text: input };
   setChat((c) => [...c, userMsg]); // this adds the users to chat ...c meaning take all existing messages, spread operator in JS
  }
  const res await fetch('BACKEND')/api/chat-combined
  this sends a message to the backend and gets a response from the backend with const data = await res.json(); // the health database
  
  data.aiResponse is response from AI - add it to chat from 'bot'


  api.js - API service for backend communication 
  base URL for backend API
  const API_BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'https://medicare-ai.up.railway.app/api';
  
  sends a message to backend - async (message) that takes sendChatMessage >
   in ChatInterface - const response = await sendChatMessage("user-message") 

   - can change different types of responses you can get in api.js with const ResponseType

- **Backend:**
  - Java Spring Boot
  - OpenAI API Integration
  - RESTful API Architecture
  
  OpenAIService.java is the main service that handles the communication APi with OpenAI
  ChatController.java is REST endpoints with URLS that API uses to handle requests - /chat-hf handles user input > output AI's response and /chat-combined handles both AI response and symptom analysis from health database

  AnalyzeController.java is the main analyzer for multilangual, this endpoint isn't finished because I gave up on this translation service until I work on it for the future.

  ConditionService.java - List<Map>String, Object>> stores condition data, each condition is a map with keys like "keywords", "description", "condition", "medication", "advice" which is loaded from JSON file on startup, I might work on this database to add more context, and make it more complex - otherwise it will stay this simple along with AI bot. 

  ## How it works 
  POST /api/chat ** User send input to backend **
   {
      "message": "I have a headache and fever"
   }

   OpenAIService.java processes it, adding a system prompt (medical context), checks JSON databse for symptom matches > sends to OpenAI API > Processes the response

   RateLimitInterceptor.java - defines the rate limit rules, 100 per bandwitch for each hour. Using Bandwidrth.builder() API which sets capacity to 100 requests, refillGreedy to refill 100 tokens every hour, I dont want to be charged too much lol

   ** This prevents API abuse and protects my APi usage while its deployed and reduces server load **


## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Java JDK 17 or higher
- OpenAI API key

### Installation
**Note: ** This is only for local development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andryuxiong/medicare-ai.git
   cd medicare-ai
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:
   ** You'd have to create your own OpenAI API Key, and insert it into OPEN_API_KEY**

3. **uncomment local development line**
   In CorseConfig.java - uncomment the local development line 
   ex. 
      .allowedOrigins(
         "http://localhost:3000", // local dev - UNCOMMENT THIS
         "https://medicare-ai-three.vercel.app" // production
      )
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here 
   ```

   Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/medicare-ui` directory:
   ```bash
   REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
   ```

4. **Start the backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

5. **Start the frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend/medicare-ui
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
